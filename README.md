A fast mapper from JSON to `NSObject`

- [x] Fast
- [x] Simple to write & read
- [x] Saves you many hours
- [x] Supports both JSON <-> `NSObject`
- [x] Designed for customisation
- [x] Built-in CoreData and Memory stores
- [x] Built-in insert or update object 

Go visit the [wiki](https://github.com/wasappli/WAMapping/wiki) for more details about `WAMapping` advanced use.

## Install and use
### Cocoapods
Use Cocoapods, this is the easiest way to install the mapper.

`pod 'WAMapping'`

`#import <WAMapping/WAMapping.h>`

### Setup mapping

On a classical use, the `source` is known as the response from a server turned into a dictionary and the `destination` is the destination object to apply the values, for example an `NSManagedObject`.

Let's assume the `Enterprise` class as follows:

```objc
@interface Enterprise : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSNumber *itemID;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSDate *creationDate;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSNumber *streetNumber;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray *employees; // Can be mutable, or an `NSSet` or an `NSOrderedSet`

@end
```

The `itemID` ids your object on the store. This is not required but recommended to avoid creating duplicates.

Assuming a json
```
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Wasappli",
    "creation_date": "2013-10-01",
    "address": {
        "street_number": 5149
    }
}
```

The mapping would looks like

```objc
WAEntityMapping *enterpriseMapping = [WAEntityMapping mappingForEntityName:@"Enterprise"];
enterpriseMapping.identificationAttribute = @"itemID";

// Add the classic attributes
[enterpriseMapping addAttributeMappingsFromDictionary:@{
                                                        @"id": @"itemID",
                                                        @"name": @"name",
                                                        @"address.street_number": @"streetNumber"
                                                        }];      
                                                   
// Map custom values. Here an `NSDate` from a string using an `NSDateTransformer`
[enterpriseMapping addMappingFromSourceProperty:@"creation_date"
                          toDestinationProperty:@"creationDate"
                                      withBlock:^id(id value) {
                                          return [dateFormatter dateFromString:value];
                                      }
                                   reverseBlock:^id(id value) {
                                       return [dateFormatter stringFromDate:value];
                                   }];

// Register the mapping for future use
WAMappingRegistrar *registrar = [WAMAppingRegistrar new];
[registrar registerMapping:enterpriseMapping];
// [registrar registerMapping:employeeMapping];
// WAEntityMapping *savedEnterpriseMapping = [registrar mappingForEntityName:@"Enterprise"];
```

And that's it...!

### Use the mapper

First, create a store. This is a required step.
I'm providing two stores on this repo: `WAMemoryStore` which relies on a simple `NSMutableSet` and `WACoreDataStore` which makes use of `CoreData`
You can easily create your own store if you want to use `NSCoding` for example, go checkout the wiki.

```objc
WAMemoryStore *store = [[WAMemoryStore alloc] init];

// or
// WACoreDataStore *store = [[WACoreDataStore alloc] initWithManagedObjectContext:localContext];
```

Then, allocate a mapper with the store

```objc
WAMapper *mapper = [[WAMapper alloc] initWithStore:store];
```

Finally, map the dictionary representation to the object:

```objc
[mapper mapFromRepresentation:json
                      mapping:enterpriseMapping
                   completion:^(NSArray *mappedObjects) {
                       firstEnterprise = [mappedObjects firstObject];
                   }];
```

And voil√†!

### Add relation ships

`WAMapping` also supports relationships:

- classics:

```
{
    "id": 1,
    "first_name": "Marian",
    "enterprise": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Wasappli",
        "creation_date": "2013-10-01",
        "address": {
            "street_number": 5149
        }
    }
}
```

```objc
WARelationshipMapping *enterpriseRelationship = 
[WARelationshipMapping relationshipMappingFromSourceProperty:@"enterprise" toDestinationProperty:@"enterprise" withMapping:enterpriseMapping];
[employeeMapping addRelationshipMapping:enterpriseRelationship];
```

- With identification attribute only

```
{
    "enterprise": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Wasappli",
        "creation_date": "2013-10-01",
        "address": {
            "street_number": 5149
        },
        "chiefs": 1 # Could also be [1, 2, 3] 
    },
    "employees": [{
                  "id": 1,
                  "first_name": "Marian"
                  }]
}
```

```objc
WARelationshipMapping *chiefsRelationship = [WARelationshipMapping relationshipMappingFromSourceIdentificationAttribute:@"chiefs" toDestinationProperty:@"chiefs" withMapping:employeeMapping];
[enterpriseMapping addRelationshipMapping:chiefsRelationship];
```

## Reverse mapper
A reverse mapper is also packaged with this library. It supports the reverse transformation from an object to a dictionary.

```objc
WAReverseMapper *reverseMapper = [[WAReverseMapper alloc] init];

json = [reverseMapper reverseMapObjects:enterprises
                            fromMapping:enterpriseMapping
                  shouldMapRelationship:nil];
```
# Side notes
## TODOs

- [ ] Benchmark against popular mappers
- [ ] Add more tests for keypath handling, especially on relationship

## Inspiration
You'll find inspiration from [Restkit](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit) and [FastEasyMapping](https://github.com/Yalantis/FastEasyMapping). These are both libraries I used on projects but with issues
